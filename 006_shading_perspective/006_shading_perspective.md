# Shading & Perspective

There are many ways to modify a surface plot to make it more appealing.
This exercise goes over a few different ways to shade a plot, and to add
perspective to it.


## Axes on / off


## Lights


## Material


## Perspective


## Shadow


## Ambient occlusion (ADVANCED)

Ambient occlusion will only work if you compiled the MEX functions that came
with gptoolbox.
If you did not, do not worry:
this part of the exercise is completely optional.


## TRY

Try writing the following functions:
* 1
* 2

As usual, the skeletons for these functions, ready for you to fill in, can be
found in `exercise/`.
